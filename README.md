MPESA API LIBRARY For C# Developers

* This documentation is only meant to help you get started on how to use this library and does not explain MPESA APIs and there internal workings or exemplifications of when and where you might want to use any of them. If you need some indepth explanation on how these Mpesa APIs work you can checkout this link ---> https://peternjeru.co.ke/safdaraja. Otherwise Safaricoms developer portal should get you sufficient detail.

Explore All existing MPESA APIs and how to generate your API Keys at Daraja - [Safaricom's Developer Portal](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/apis-explorer)

## Note
* *Access tokens generated by the [Authclient](https://github.com/ayiemba/MpesaLib/blob/master/src/MpesaLib/Clients/AuthClient.cs) expire after an hour (this is documented in Daraja).*

* *Users of MpesaLib should ensure they handle token expriration in their code. A quick solution would be to put the semaphore in a try/catch/finally block as documented in [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49304326/refresh-token-using-static-httpclient) from stackoverflow.*

## 1. HOW TO USE In an ASP.NET Core Web Application

* Run `Install-Package MpesaLib -Version 1.0.8` in Package Manager Console or go to Manage Nuget Packages, Search and install MpesaLib
* Add usings ```c# using MpesaLib.Clients; ```
* Inject Mpesa API Clients in DI Container; For asp.net core core this can be done in Startup.cs. 
** *Note that there are about 10 mpesa api clients. Only register or new up the ones you need in your code.

```c#
    //Add AuthClient - gets you accesstokens (This is manadatory)
    services.AddHttpClient<AuthClient>();
    
    //Add LipaNaMpesaOnlineClient - makes STK Push payment requests
    services.AddHttpClient<LipaNaMpesaOnlineClient>();
    
    //Add C2BRegisterUrlClient - register your callback URLS, goes hand-in-hand with the C2BClient
    services.AddHttpClient<C2BRegisterUrlClient>();
    
    //Add C2BClient - makes customer to business payment requests 
    services.AddHttpClient<C2BClient>();
    
    //Add B2BClient - makes business to business payment requests
    services.AddHttpClient<B2BClient>();
    
    //Add B2CClient - makes business to customer payment requests
    services.AddHttpClient<B2CClient>();
    
    //Add LipaNaMpesaQueryClient - Query status of a LipaNaMpesaOnline Payment request
    services.AddHttpClient<LipaNaMpesaQueryClient>();
    
    //Add TransactionReversalClient - Reverses Mpesa transactions
    services.AddHttpClient<LipaNaMpesaOnlineClient>();
    
    //Add TransactionStatusClient - Query status of transaction requests
    services.AddHttpClient<LipaNaMpesaOnlineClient>();   
    
```
* In your Controller Instantiate the clients in constructor... (in this case am instantiating the AuthClient and LipaNaMpesaOnlineClient. And of cos i pull my API Keys and secrets from configuration.

```c#
    public class PaymentsController : Controller
    {
        private readonly AuthClient _auth;
        private LipaNaMpesaOnlineClient _lipaNaMpesa;        
        private readonly IConfiguration _config;

        public PaymentsController(AuthClient auth, LipaNaMpesaOnlineClient lipaNampesa, IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            _auth = auth;
            _lipaNaMpesa = lipaNampesa;            
            _config = configuration;
        }
        ...
        //Code omitted for brevity
```
* You can store your ConsumerKey and ConsumerSecret in appsettings.json as follows

```json
     "MpesaConfiguration": {
         "ConsumerKey": "[Your Mpesa ConsumerKey from daraja]",
         "ConsumerSecret": "[Your Mpesa ConsumerSecret from daraja]"
       }
```

* Generate `accesstoken` using the AuthClient

```c#
        // GET: /<controller>/
        public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
        {
            var consumerKey = _config["MpesaConfiguration:ConsumerKey"];

            var consumerSecret = _config["MpesaConfiguration:ConsumerSecret"];

            var accesstoken = await _auth.GetToken(consumerKey,consumerSecret);
            
            ...
        //code omitted for brevity
```

* To use Send Request to LipaNaMpesaOnline, initialize the LipaNaMpesaOnline object by providing values for it's properties

```c#
      LipaNaMpesaOnline lipaonline = new LipaNaMpesaOnline
      {
          AccountReference = "test",
          Amount = "1",
          PartyA = "254708374149",
          PartyB = "174379",
          BusinessShortCode = "174379",
          CallBackURL = "[your callback url, i wish i could help but you'll have to write your own]",
          Password = "daraga explains on how to get password",
          PhoneNumber = "254708374149",
          Timestamp = "20180716124916",//DateTime.Now.ToString("yyyyMMddHHmmss"),
          TransactionDesc = "test"
          TransactionType = "CustomerPayBillOnline" //I am using this by default, you might wanna check the other option
      };
```

* You can then make a payment request in your controller as follows..

```c#
var paymentrequest = await _lipaNaMpesa.MakePayment(lipaonline, accesstoken);
```

* (Not Recommended) - If you dont want to use Dependency Injection you can just New-Up the clients and use them like this..
```c#
   LipaNaMpesaOnlineClient LipaNaMpesa = new LipaNaMpesaOnlineClient();
   ...
   ...
   var paymentrequest = await LipaNaMpesa.MakePayment(lipaonline, accesstoken);
```
* Do whatever you want with the results of the request... (Of cos i plan to make these docs better in the future)
