Explore All existing MPESA APIs and how to generate your API Keys at Daraja - [Safaricom's Developer Portal](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/apis-explorer)

## Note
* Access tokens generated by the [Authclient](https://github.com/ayiemba/MpesaLib/blob/master/src/MpesaLib/Clients/AuthClient.cs) expires after an hour (this is documented in Daraja). Users of this library should ensure they handle token expriration in their code. An quick solution would be to check for 403 errors then request a new token to use with the other apis.
