## Note
* *Access tokens generated by the [Authclient](https://github.com/ayiemba/MpesaLib/blob/master/src/MpesaLib/Clients/AuthClient.cs) expire after an hour (this is documented in Daraja).*

* *Users of MpesaLib should ensure they handle token expriration in their code. A quick solution would be to put the semaphore in a try/catch/finally block as documented in [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49304326/refresh-token-using-static-httpclient) from stackoverflow.*
